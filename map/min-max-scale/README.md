##How to use the sample##
The ArcGISMap has a minimum and maximum scale set which locks the map view in-between that range.

##How it works##
To set the min and max scales on a `ArcGISMap`:

1. Create an ArcGISMap.  
2. Set min and max scales of map, `ArcGISMap.setMaxScale()` and `ArcGISMap.setMinScale()`.
3. Set the ArcGISMap to the `MapView`.
