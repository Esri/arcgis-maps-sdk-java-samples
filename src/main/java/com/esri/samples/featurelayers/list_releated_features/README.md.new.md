# List Related Features

Find features related to the selected feature.

## How to use the sample

After the layer is loaded, click on a feature to select it. An accordion
view will display related features grouped by feature table.

## How it works

To query related `Feature`s:

1.  Get a `Feature` from a loaded `FeatureLayer`.

2.  Get the feature’s `FeatureTable` and call
    `featureTable.queryRelatedFeaturesAsync(feature)`.

3.  You will get a list of `RelatedFeatureQueryResult`s.
    
      - You can get the name of the table containing the related
        features with `relatedFeatureQueryResult
        .getRelatedTable().getTableName()`.

4.  The `RelatedFeatureQueryResult` implements `Iterable<Feature>`. You
    can iterate over the result to get the features:
    
        for (Feature feature: relatedFeatureQueryResult) {
          //do something with the related feature...
          }
